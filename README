A free graduate Econometrics textbook
=====================================

The goal of this project is to produce and maintain as a community a
free textbook/research monograph on Econometrics suitable for teaching
a PhD core course and make it available through the [GNU Free
Documentation License] (http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html).

The project is at version 0.7.1 and is just getting started. Use at
your own risk!

Downloads
---------

* pdfs can be downloaded from GitHub here:
  <https://github.com/EconometricsLibrary/core/releases>
* The source code can be downloaded from GitHub here:
  <https://github.com/EconometricsLibrary/core>
* The project homepage is here:
  <http://www.econometricslibrary.org/core>

Material covered
----------------

* Probability
* Finite sample inference
* Asymptotics
* Linear regression

Dependencies
------------

The pdf files are generated by `pdflatex` and this is simplified by
`latexmk`.  To install these programs in Ubuntu 13, run the following
command at the terminal (as superuser)

    apt-get install latexmk texlive-latex-extra \
      texlive-math-extra texlive-fonts-extra texlive-pictures

These packages can take a while to download.

Figures for the bootstrap section (in "Asymptotics") are generated by
R and use the knitr package.  See <http://www.r-project.org> for
details on installing it.

The build script is written as a makefile and depends on GNU Make,
which is installed on Linux by default.

The build process has been tested with TeX Live 2012 and 2013 under
Ubuntu Linux.  If you succeed in building the pdfs under a different
setup, please let us know; ditto if you run into problems.  Contact
information is listed at the end of this file and the next development
notes may be helpful in troubleshooting problems.

Development notes
-----------------

* To generate pdfs, run the command `make` in the top-level directory
  of this project (you'll need to have `make` installed, obviously).

* If you do not have `make` and `latexmk` installed, you can run
  `latex` manually from the command line:

      latex -pdf core_econometrics.tex
      bibtex core_econometrics.aux
      latex -pdf core_econometrics.tex
      latex -pdf core_econometrics.tex

  But `make` also generates some graphs, and they will be missing from
  the final pdf if you run LaTeX manually. (The source file will only
  load the image files if they exist, so you should be able to
  successfully build a pdf file either way.)

* Please email the mailing list (see below) if you run into problems
  or have any other questions.
