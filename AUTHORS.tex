The following is a list of the contributors to the Econometrics Free
Library Project's \textit{Econometrics Core}, in order of their date
of first involvement (yes, I'm aware that it's a little ridiculous to
have this as a separate file when there is only a single contributor,
but let's dream big, shall we).
