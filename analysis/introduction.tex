\section{Introduction}

Lots more to add here. In the meantime, look at the following in
\citet{IW07}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Estimation of average treatment effects under
    unconfoundedness}
  (\url{http://www.nber.org/WNE/lect_1_match_fig.pdf})
\item \textit{Instrumental variables with treatment effect
    heterogeneity: local average treatment effects}
  (\url{http://www.nber.org/WNE/lect_13_weakmany_iv.pdf})
\item \textit{Weak instruments and many instruments}
  (\url{http://www.nber.org/WNE/lect_5_late_fig.pdf})
\item \textit{Discrete choice models}
  (\url{http://www.nber.org/WNE/lect_11_dc_fig.pdf})
\item \textit{Missing data}
  (\url{http://www.nber.org/WNE/lect_12_missing.pdf})
\end{itemize}
as well as \citet{IW09}. The plan is to present mostly
program-evaluation notation and results and let future coursework fill
in estimating structural models.
