\section{Asymptotic Efficiency}

\begin{itemize}
\item To talk about efficiency, we need to restrict our attention to
      asymptotically normal estimators
\begin{itemize}
\item rules out pathalogical counterexamples
\item I should add one next year (homework?)
\item kind of makes sense; for normal r.v. only the mean and
        variance matter; for other asymp. distributions other
        parameters are more important.
\end{itemize}
\item If $\θh_n$ satisfies $m_n (\θh_n - θ) →^d N(0, σ²)$ for some
  (increasing) sequence $m_n$ then $σ²$ is the asymptotic variance of
  $\θh_n$.
\item Suppose that $X_1,...,X_n$ have the likelihood fn $L(θ; X)$ and
  that $\θh_n$ is a sequence of estimators of $θ$.  $\θh_n$ is
  asymptotically efficient for $θ$ if $m_n (\θh_n - θ) \to^d N(0, σ²)$
  and
  \[σ² = \Big[\E_θ ((\tfrac{∂}{∂θ} \log L(θ; X))²)\big]^{-1}\].
\begin{itemize}
\item i.e. $\θh_n$ achieves the CR lower bound in the limit.
\end{itemize}
\item Nice result: under regularity conditions (like we saw before),
      MLEs are consistent and asymptotically normal as well as
      efficient.
\end{itemize}
