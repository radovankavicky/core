A free graduate Econometrics textbook
=====================================

The goal of this project is to produce and maintain as a community a
free textbook/research monograph on Econometrics suitable for teaching
a PhD core course and make it available through the
[GNU Free Documentation License](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html).

The project is just getting started. Use at your own risk!

Downloads
---------

* pdfs can be downloaded from GitHub here:
  <https://github.com/EconometricsLibrary/CoreEconometricsText/releases>
* The source code can be downloaded from GitHub here:
  <https://github.com/EconometricsLibrary/CoreEconometricsText>
* The project homepage is here:
  <http://www.econometricslibrary.org/>

Material covered
----------------

* Probability (see probability.tex for a list of sections)
* Finite sample inference (finitesample.tex)
* Asymptotics (asymptotics.tex)
* Linear regression (regression.tex)

Dependencies
------------

The pdf files are generated by `xelatex` and this is simplified by
`latexmk`.  To install these programs in Ubuntu 13, run the following
command at the terminal (as superuser)

    apt-get install texlive-xetex latexmk \
    texlive-latex-extra texlive-math-extra texlive-fonts-extra texlive-pictures

These packages can take a while to download.

The build process has been tested with TeX Live 2012 and 2013 under
Ubuntu Linux.  If you succeed in building the pdfs under a different
setup, please let us know; ditto if you run into problems.  Contact
information is listed at the end of this file and the next development
notes may be helpful in troubleshooting problems.

Development notes
-----------------

* To generate pdfs, run the command `make` in the top-level directory
  of this project (you'll need to have `make` installed, obviously).
  Running `make -j` will build the pdfs in parallel.

* Type `make ver` to update the date and version information included
  in each pdf file; the files VERSION.tex and CITATION.bib are
  placeholders that exist so that the files can be compiled without
  error, and `make ver` will replace them with the correct information.

  Alternatively, you can edit the date macro in VERSION.tex and bibtex
  entry in CITATION.bib manually:

      git show -s --date=short --format=%cd | head -c 4

  gives the date of the latest commit (and other log information) and 

      git describe --tags

  gives the version number.

* After VERSION.tex and CITATION.bib are updated with the correct date
  and version information, `git status` will list them as modified
  files.  Use

      git update-index --assume-unchanged VERSION.tex CITATION.bib

  to tell git to ignore changes in those files.  This command can be
  reversed with

      git update-index --no-assume-unchanged VERSION.tex CITATION.bib

  Before checking out any commit that predates version 0.3.2 (when
  placeholders for those files were first added to the repo), you may
  need to first run the command

      git checkout -- VERSION.tex CITATION.bib

  to reset the files.

* If you do not have `make` and `latexmk` installed, you can run
  `xelatex` manually from the command line:

      xelatex probability.tex
      bibtex probability.aux
      xelatex probability.tex
      xelatex probability.tex

  and again for each of the five files listed above.

* Please email the mailing list (see below) if you run into problems
  or have any other questions.
