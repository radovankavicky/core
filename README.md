A free graduate Econometrics textbook
=====================================

The goal of this project is to produce and maintain as a community a
free textbook/research monograph on Econometrics suitable for teaching
a PhD core course and make it available through the
[GNU Free Documentation License](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html).

The project is just getting started. Use at your own risk!

Downloads
---------

* pdfs can be downloaded from GitHub here:
  <https://github.com/EconometricsLibrary/CoreEconometricsText/releases>
* The source code can be downloaded from GitHub here:
  <https://github.com/EconometricsLibrary/CoreEconometricsText>
* The project homepage is here:

Material covered
----------------

* Probability (see probability.tex for a list of sections)
* Point estimation and confidence regions (estimation.tex)
* Hypothesis testing and Bayesian inference (inference.tex)
* Asymptotics (asymptotics.tex)
* Linear regression (regression.tex)

Development Notes
-----------------

* To generate pdfs, run the command `make` in the top-level directory
  of this project (you'll need to have `make` installed, obviously).
  Running `make -j` will build the pdfs in parallel.

* Type `make ver` to update the date and version information included
  in each pdf file; the files VERSION.tex and CITATION.bib are
  placeholders that exist so that the files can be compiled without
  error, and `make ver` will replace them with the correct information.

  Alternatively, you can edit the date macro in VERSION.tex and bibtex
  entry in CITATION.bib manually:

      git show -s --date=short --format=%cd | head -c 4

  gives the date of the latest commit (and other log information) and 

      git describe --tags

  gives the version number.

* If you do not have `make` and `latexmk` installed, you can run
  `xelatex` manually from the command line:

      xelatex probability.tex
      bibtex probability.aux
      xelatex probability.tex
      xelatex probability.tex

  and again for each of the five files listed above.

* Please email the mailing list (see below) if you run into problems
  or have any other questions.
