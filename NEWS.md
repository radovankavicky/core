### Version 0.3.4
This commit edits several parts of the inference material and makes
many internal changes that should make organizing and compiling the
files easier.  It also renames the book to be *Core Econometrics
Textbook*.

### Version 0.3.3
A patch: the previous commit broke compilation of the pdfs by
including the same source into several documents. This commit undoes
that problem by changing 'include' to 'input'.  (This was a problem
when running parallel make).

### Version 0.3.2
A housekeeping release, mostly:
* Adds the 'http://' prefix back to URLs so that they work in more pdf
  readers
* Updates the README file with more useful directions on compiling
  pdfs
* Adds placeholder files for version and citation information to
  prevent compilation errors
* Changes to include the author list and license in each pdf by
  default
* Renames the linear regression file

### Version 0.3.1
This release marks a major rewrite of the "estimation" section,
changing it from a loose outline to something of a coherent document.
It also edits the Bayesian inference somewhat.

Version 0.3.0
-------------
This release is a major rewrite of the probability section, which
changes it from a loose outline to sentences and paragraphs.  The
release also reorganizes some material later in the book, but the
emphasis is on the probability material.

### Version 0.2.5, hotfix release
* Fixes a bug in the 'addcontentsline' command before the bibliography.

### Version 0.2.4
* Changes the author to 'Gray Calhoun.'  I'm not thrilled with this
  change, but I am the only author at the moment and I think having
  'EFLP' as the sole author is confusing.  See inline comments for
  more details.

### Version 0.2.3
* Hotfix release to remove redundant 'version' from bibtex entry

### Version 0.2.2
* Generate bibtex entry for the textbook and add to the book's
  preamble automatically.
* Remove the ugly 'http://' from the front of URLs.

### Version 0.2.1
* Converts LaTeX characters to Unicode where possible.
* Reduces TOC depth

Version 0.2.0
-------------
* Removes most of the lecture-notes cruft from the documents;
  references to specific dates, exams, etc.
* Splits the authors list into a separate appendix
* Cleans up the README file
* Moves 'shared' documents into the main repo to make development
  faster and easier.

### Version 0.1.4
* Add homework problems to each document
* Add table of set theory results that was a former handout
* Split off linear regression materials as a separate document
* Move licensing information to a standalone handout
* Split off versioning information from repo and generate document
  dates on-the-fly (type make ver; make -j).

### Version 0.1.3, hotfix release
Wildcard expansion in the pdf dependencies still isn't working, so
this patch switches back to list the individual pdfs explicitly.  It's
not very exciting, but there aren't many pdf files so it shouldn't be
too much of a pain to deal with manually.

### Version 0.1.2, hotfix release
The Makefile wasn't handling automatic directory detection well.  This
release puts the pdfs into a variable and uses the wildcard function
explictly in a double colon rule to solve the problem.

### Version 0.1.1
* Moves preamble material to a shared repository and streamlines the
  code
* Fixes some issues in the appearance of the main texts
* Changes to a more informative title and author

Version 0.1.0
-------------
* Move latex-class files to a versioned mirror of the tufte-latex
  project
* Move document preambles to a separate versioned subtree,
  latex-shared
* Group the Econometrics notes into several separate documents

### Version 0.0.1
Add LaTeX files for Gray Calhoun's old lecture notes; there's still a
lot of work that needs to be done to clean them up, but the project
actually has some content now.
