\paragraph{description of the goals}
\begin{itemize}
\item What are we hoping to do?
\begin{itemize}
\item we probably have in mind changing one of these variables
\begin{itemize}
\item conceivably, could change number of teachers per student
\item conceivably, could change money available per student
\end{itemize}
\item so, we want something like (informally) E(change in reading
          score | an independent body makes a 1\% change in expenditure)
\end{itemize}
\item what makes econometrics distinctive?
\begin{itemize}
\item we \underline{don't} always get to observe changes in expenditure and
          changes in scores
\begin{itemize}
\item sometimes we do
\item sometimes we see levels of expenditure and levels scores
\end{itemize}
\item we almost never get to observe \underline{changes made by an independent           body}.
\begin{itemize}
\item often, you'll see changes that were made for some reason
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{\underline{the key strategy for empirical research}}
\begin{itemize}
\item an important message before we start
\begin{itemize}
\item think about what experiment you would \textbf{want to design} if you
          could
\begin{itemize}
\item one approach if we want to understand how expenditure affects student
            reading test scores, we'd want to take all of the schools
\item \textbf{randomly} and \textbf{independently} change their funding (leave
            some unchanged)
\item observe the change in test scores the next year
\end{itemize}
\item then think hard about how closely the process that created
          your data matches that experiment
\begin{itemize}
\item this can be an iterative process
\end{itemize}
\item if you can not think of an experiment, the question might not
          be an empirical question
\begin{itemize}
\item sometimes this happens when you think about changing
            preference parameters
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{description of the ``environment''}
\begin{itemize}
\item have n data points (observations)
\item have k+1 regressors
\item believe that there's a relationship between the dependent
        variable and the regressors:
        \[\begin{pmatrix} Y₁ \\ ⋮ \\ Y_n\end{pmatrix}
        = \begin{pmatrix} 
        X_{1,0} & X_{1,1} & ⋯ & X_{1,k} \\
        ⋮ \\
        X_{n,0} & X_{n,1} & ⋯ & X_{n,k} \end{pmatrix}
        \begin{pmatrix}  β₀ \\ ⋮ \\ β_k \end{pmatrix}+ 
        \begin{pmatrix} \ep₁ \\ ⋮ \\ \ep_n \end{pmatrix} \]
\begin{itemize}
\item $Y$ is the response vector
\item $X$ is the design matrix
\item $β$ is the vector of unknown coefficients
\item $\ep$ is the error
\item so, the ith row of this relationship is
  \[Y_i = X_{i,0} β₀ + X_{i,1} β₁ + ⋯ + X_{i,k} β_k + \ep_i\]
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{informal motivation}
\begin{itemize}
\item In matrix form: $Y = X β + \ep$
\item if the error is small, then $Y ≈ Xβ$
\begin{itemize}
\item so $X'Y ≈ X'X β$
\begin{itemize}
\item $X'X$ will be invertible if $X$ has full rank
\end{itemize}
\item and then $β ≈ (X'X)^{-1} X'Y$
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{outline of the second half of the course}

\begin{itemize}
\item we're going to talk mostly about this estimator and slight
       variations of it
\begin{itemize}
\item what it does (under what assumptions)
\item what it \textbf{doesn't} do
\end{itemize}
\item next semester, you'll discuss improvements
\end{itemize}
